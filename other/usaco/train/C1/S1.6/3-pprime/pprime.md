## Prime Palindromes

The number 151 is a prime palindrome because it is both a prime number and a palindrome (it is the same number when read forward as backward). 
Write a program that finds all prime palindromes in the range of two supplied numbers a and b (5 <= a < b <= 100,000,000); 
both a and b are considered to be within the range .

## PROGRAM NAME: pprime
