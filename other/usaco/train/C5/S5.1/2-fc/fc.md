Fencing the Cows
Hal Burch
Frugal Farmer John wishes to build a fence to contain his cows and all of their favorite grazing spots. Given the location of these grazing spots, determine the length of the shortest fence which encloses them.

PROGRAM NAME: fc
INPUT FORMAT
The first line of the input file contains one integer, N (0 <= N <= 10,000), the number of grazing spots that Farmer john wishes to enclose.

Each of the next N lines contains two real numbers, Xi and Yi (-1,000,000 <= Xi,Yi <= 1,000,000), corresponding to the locations of the grazing spots in the plane. The numbers will be in decimal format (i.e., not exponential format).

SAMPLE INPUT (file fc.in)

4 8
4 12
5 9.3
7 8
OUTPUT FORMAT
The output line comprises a single real number (printed to exactly two decimal places) that is the length of shortest fence required.
