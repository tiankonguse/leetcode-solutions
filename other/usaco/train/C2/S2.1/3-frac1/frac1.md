# Ordered Fractions

Consider the set of all reduced fractions between 0 and 1 inclusive with denominators less than or equal to N.

Here is the set when N = 5:

0/1 1/5 1/4 1/3 2/5 1/2 3/5 2/3 3/4 4/5 1/1
Write a program that, given an integer N between 1 and 160 inclusive, prints the fractions in order of increasing magnitude.
