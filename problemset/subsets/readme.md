# Subsets 

Given a set of distinct integers, S, return all possible subsets.  

Note:  

Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.  

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.  

For example,  

If S = `[1,2,3]`, a solution is:  


```
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```
