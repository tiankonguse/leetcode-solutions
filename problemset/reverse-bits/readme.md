# Reverse Bits


Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

For example, given input 43261596 (represented in binary as `00000010100101000001111010011100`), return 964176192 (represented in binary as `00111001011110000010100101000000`).

Follow up:
If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
