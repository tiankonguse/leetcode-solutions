# Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.  


For example:  

Given binary tree `{1,#,2,3}`,  

```
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
```

return `[1,3,2]`.

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?  

confused what `"{1,#,2,3}"` means?  

read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.  


OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:  

The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where `'#'` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.  

Here's an example:  

```
   1
  / \
 2   3
    /
   4
    \
     5
```

The above binary tree is serialized as `"{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}"`.
