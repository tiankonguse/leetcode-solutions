# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.   
(ie, from left to right, level by level).  

For example:  

Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},  

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its level order traversal as:   

```
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
```

confused what `"{1,#,2,3}"` means?

OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:  

The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where `'#'` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.  

Here's an example:

```
   1
  / \
 2   3
    /
   4
    \
     5
```

The above binary tree is serialized as `"{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}"`.
