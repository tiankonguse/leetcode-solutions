# Surrounded Regions 

iven a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'`, capture all regions surrounded by `'X'`.  

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.  

For example,  

```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```

After running your function, the board should be:  

```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```
