# Compare Version Numbers

Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.
If version1 `>` version2 return 1, if version1 `<` version2 return -1, otherwise return 0.

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the `.` character.  

The `.` character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.  

For instance, `2.5` is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three",   

it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.  


Here is an example of version numbers ordering:  

```
0.1 < 1.1 < 1.2 < 13.37
```
