#  42. Trapping Rain Water

Given an m x n matrix of positive integers representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, compute the volume of water it is able to trap after raining.

Note:
Both m and n are less than 110. The height of each unit cell is greater than 0 and is less than 20,000.

Example:

Given the following 3x6 height map:

```
[
  [1,4,3,1,3,2],
  [3,2,1,3,2,4],
  [2,3,3,2,3,1]
]
```

Return `4`.

The above image represents the elevation map `[[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]` before the rain.

After the rain, water are trapped between the blocks. The total volume of water trapped is 4.
