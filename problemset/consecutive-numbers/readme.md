# Consecutive Numbers 

Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.  

```
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
```

For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.  

```
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
+       1         |
+-----------------+
```
