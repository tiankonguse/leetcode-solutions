# Path Sum

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.  


For example:  

Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,  

```
              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \      \
        7    2      1
```

return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path `5->4->11->2` which sum is 22.
