## 564. Find the Closest Palindrome

Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome.

The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.


## Example 1:

```
Input: "123"
Output: "121"
```


## Note:

The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18.  
If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.
