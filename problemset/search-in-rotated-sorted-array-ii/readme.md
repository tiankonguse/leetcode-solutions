Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.

The array may contain duplicates.

g++ -std=c++11 search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii.cpp
