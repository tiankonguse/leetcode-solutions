# Swap Nodes in Pairs

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.  

For example,  
Given `1->2->3->4`, you should return the list as `2->1->4->3`.  

Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.
