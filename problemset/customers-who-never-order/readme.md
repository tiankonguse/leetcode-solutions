# Customers Who Never Order 

Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.  

Table: Customers.  

```
+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
```

Table: Orders.  

```
+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
```

Using the above tables as example, return the following:  

```
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```
