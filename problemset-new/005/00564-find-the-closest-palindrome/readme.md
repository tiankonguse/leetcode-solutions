## 564. Find the Closest Palindrome



Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome.



The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.





## Example 1:



```

Input: "123"

Output: "121"

```





## Note:



The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18.  

If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.
