# Remove Nth Node From End of List

给你一个链表，删除链表的倒数第 n 个结点，并且返回链表的头结点。


Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,

   Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

   After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
Note:
Given n will always be valid.
Try to do this in one pass.
