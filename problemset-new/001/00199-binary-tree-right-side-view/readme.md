# Binary Tree Right Side View


Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.  

For example:  
Given the following binary tree,  

```
   1            <---
 /   \
2     3         <---
 \     \
  5    4       <---
```

You should return `[1, 3, 4]`.
