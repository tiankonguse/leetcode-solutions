# Clone Graph

Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.  


OJ's undirected graph serialization:  
Nodes are labeled uniquely.  

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.  
As an example, consider the serialized graph `{0,1,2#1,2#2,2}`.  

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.  

First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.  
Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.  
Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.  
Visually, the graph looks like the following:  

```
       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/
```
