# Longest Consecutive Sequence 

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.  

For example,  

Given `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`,  

The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Return its length: 4.  

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
